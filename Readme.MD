# Configuration

The configuration is straightforward. Below is an example of the configuration file:
```json
{
  "log_file": "log.json",  // the name you want to give your log file where trades done are logged. Also errors.
  "auth_token": "5CwfzRLTBcU2x4KnuqF",  // Your tradingview webhook auth code. secures api calls
  "tradeAmount": 10,  // The amount in dollars or percentage you want to execute trades for.
  "investmentType": "FIXED",  // FIXED = TradeAmount is using dollars so 10 = $10 dollars, PERCENTAGE = TradeAmount is percentage so 10 = 10% of your total USDT Pionex account balance
  "pionex": {
    "apiKey": "pionexApiKey",  // pionex apikey found in pionex settings
    "secret": "pionexApiSecret"  // pionex apikey secret found in pionex settings when creating api key
  },
  "enabled": true  // setting to say if the bot should process tradingview alert signals or not. true or false. For quick disable
}
```
